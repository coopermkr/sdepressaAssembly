# sdepressaAssembly

This repo tracks the multi-program workflow used to assemble a Salicornia depressa reference genome. I included notes on program installation and configuration, the code used to assemble this reference, and editorial comments packaged into the repo's wiki. This documentation is meant to serve as a companion to a Genome Resource Report in Journal of Heredity once it is finished.

This guide was initiated based on documentation and tips provided by Alex Harkess at Hudson Alpha for the assembly of a Toomer reference genome.
